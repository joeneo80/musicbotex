## What does it do?

MusicBotEX does a number of things to extent MusicBot's functionality.

For the sake of lists, here's a list:

- It can record and play back voice
- Users can save the currently playing song if they want to
- Users can upload MP3s for the bot to play
- It can @ mention people when their song comes up on the queue
- It can use multiple music sources instead of the restricted list that MusicBot uses
- It can connect to YouTube streams so you can listen to live music

And much more.

## How do I use it?

It's simple.

* First, make sure MusicBot is already running (runbot.bat).
* Then, download and extract MusicBotEX (link at top of this page)
* Then, run MusicBotEX.exe, while MusicBot is running.

It's that simple!

## How does it work?

MusicBotEX and MusicBot both use Python, which means that the two programs can interact and work together.

Programming it was a bunch of threading hell, but I can sum it up by saying one process fucks with the other.

## Can I donate?

Yes! Donation links are coming soon.

Your money is appreciated!
