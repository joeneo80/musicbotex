## What does it do?

MusicBotEX does a number of things to extent MusicBot's functionality.
For the sake of lists, here's a list:

- It can record and play back voice
- Users can save the currently playing song if they want to
- Users can upload MP3s for the bot to play
- It can @ mention people when their song comes up on the queue
- It can use multiple music sources instead of the restricted list that MusicBot uses
- It can connect to YouTube streams so you can listen to live music

And much more.

## How do I use it?
